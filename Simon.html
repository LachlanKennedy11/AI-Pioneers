        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üåç Early Life & Career</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Born:</strong> 1916 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> He earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago.</li>
                <li><strong>Diverse Interests:</strong> Simon was a true polymath, with contributions to psychology, economics, computer science, and AI.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: The Logic Theory Machine -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üß† The Logic Theory Machine</h2>
            <p>In 1956, Simon and his colleagues created the Logic Theory Machine (LTM), which is considered one of the first AI programs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> LTM was designed to prove mathematical theorems from a set of axioms.</li>
                <li><strong>Groundbreaking:</strong> This program demonstrated that computers could perform tasks that had previously been considered to require human intelligence, like problem-solving.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> It was a huge step in showing that the field of AI was possible.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Bounded Rationality and Satisficing -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üí° Bounded Rationality and Satisficing</h2>
            <p>Simon's most famous idea in economics and decision-making is "bounded rationality."</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Concept:</strong> Instead of making perfect, rational decisions, humans often make "good enough" decisions because they have limited information and time.</li>
                <li><strong>Satisficing:</strong> He coined the term "satisficing," which is a combination of "satisfy" and "suffice." It means making a decision that is good enough, not necessarily the best.</li>
                <li><strong>Relevance to AI:</strong> This concept has influenced AI research by showing that real-world problem-solving often requires finding a workable solution, not a perfect one.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Legacy & Awards -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>ü§ù Legacy & Awards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nobel Prize:</strong> In 1978, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on decision-making processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Turing Award:</strong> In 1975, he received the A.M. Turing Award for his foundational work on AI. He is one of the few people to have won both a Nobel Prize and a Turing Award.</li>
                <li><strong>Cognitive Science:</strong> He is one of the founders of the field of cognitive science, which studies how the human mind works.</li>
