            <h2>üåç Early Life & The Dartmouth Workshop</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Born:</strong> 1927 in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> He received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University.</li>
                <li><strong>The Birth of a Field:</strong> In 1955, he and others organized a summer research project at Dartmouth College. It was here that he coined the term "Artificial Intelligence".</li>
                <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> The workshop aimed to bring together brilliant minds to explore how to make machines that could think and reason like humans.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Slide 3: The Lisp Programming Language -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üíª The Lisp Programming Language</h2>
            <p>In the late 1950s, McCarthy created Lisp, a new programming language designed specifically for AI research.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Key Feature:</strong> Lisp was built for symbolic computation, which is the manipulation of symbols and lists of data, rather than just numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> It became the standard language for AI research for decades and is still used today.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> It was one of the first programming languages to use a concept called "garbage collection," which helps manage computer memory.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Other Key Contributions -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üöÄ Other Key Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Time-Sharing Systems:</strong> McCarthy pioneered the concept of time-sharing, which allows multiple users to access a single computer at the same time.</li>
                <li><strong>Commonsense Reasoning:</strong> He was a strong believer that for AI to be truly intelligent, it needed to be able to reason about the world in a way that humans do, using common sense.</li>
                <li><strong>The "AI Effect":</strong> He humorously noted that as soon as a computer program successfully performs a task, people no longer consider it "artificial intelligence."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Legacy & Awards -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>ü§ù Legacy & Awards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Turing Award:</strong> In 1971, he received the A.M. Turing Award for his foundational work on AI.</li>
                <li><strong>The Name "AI":</strong> McCarthy's most lasting legacy might be the term "Artificial Intelligence" itself, which defined an entire field of research.</li>
                <li><strong>Stanford University:</strong> He was a professor at Stanford for many years, where he established the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL).</li>
