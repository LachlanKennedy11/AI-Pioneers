            <h2>üåç Early Life & Career</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> He earned a Ph.D. from the University of Southern California (USC).</li>
                <li><strong>Google Brain:</strong> A significant part of his career was spent at Google Brain, where he was a key researcher working on machine learning and natural language processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Adept:</strong> After leaving Google, he co-founded Adept, an AI company focused on building an AI that can perform complex tasks.</li>

            <h2>üß† "Attention Is All You Need" Paper</h2>
            <p>In 2017, Ashish Vaswani and his co-authors at Google published this groundbreaking paper.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Core Idea:</strong> The paper introduced the Transformer architecture, which uses a mechanism called "self-attention" to process input data.</li>
                <li><strong>The Shift:</strong> This was a huge change from the previous standard, which used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data like text.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Benefit:</strong> The Transformer can process all parts of an input sequence in parallel, making it much faster and more efficient to train on large datasets.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: The Transformer Architecture -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üí° The Transformer Architecture</h2>
            <p>The Transformer is now the backbone of modern AI.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wide Adoption:</strong> The Transformer architecture is the foundation for almost all large language models (LLMs) used today, including models like Gemini, GPT, and BERT.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications:</strong> It has enabled massive improvements in machine translation, text summarization, and a wide range of other natural language processing tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Enduring Impact:</strong> Its design fundamentally changed the way AI models are built and trained.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>ü§ù Legacy & Influence</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Modern AI Era:</strong> Ashish Vaswani's work is directly responsible for the rapid advancements in AI that we've seen since 2017.</li>
                <li><strong>The Power of Attention:</strong> He and his co-authors showed that a simple but powerful idea‚Äîattention‚Äîwas all that was needed to revolutionize the field.</li>
                <li><strong>Continuing Research:</strong> His work continues to influence new research directions, and his contributions are seen as a cornerstone of the AI boom.</li>
