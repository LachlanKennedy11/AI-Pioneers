            <p>A Pioneer of Cognitive Science and Computer Science.</p>

        <!-- Slide 2: Early Life & Career -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üåç Early Life & Career</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Born:</strong> 1927 in San Francisco, U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> He earned a B.S. in Physics from Stanford University and later a Ph.D. from Carnegie Institute of Technology.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Work:</strong> After serving in the U.S. Navy, he joined the RAND Corporation, a research think tank, where he began his work on problem-solving and decision-making.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Partnership:</strong> It was at RAND that he began his long and highly influential collaboration with Herbert A. Simon.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: The Logic Theorist -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üí° The Logic Theorist (1956)</h2>
            <p>In collaboration with Herbert Simon and Cliff Shaw, Newell developed the Logic Theorist, one of the first true artificial intelligence programs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What it Did:</strong> The program was able to prove mathematical theorems, a task previously thought to require human-like reasoning.</li>
                <li><strong>Significance:</strong> It was a foundational project that showed computers could perform symbolic reasoning, not just numerical calculations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: The General Problem Solver -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üöÄ The General Problem Solver (GPS)</h2>
            <p>Building on the success of the Logic Theorist, Newell and his colleagues created the GPS, a more ambitious program.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> To create a universal problem-solver that could tackle any problem expressed in a formal language.</li>
                <li><strong>Core Idea:</strong> It used a technique called "means-ends analysis," which involves finding the difference between the current state and the goal state and then reducing that difference.</li>
                <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> GPS was a key step in separating a program's knowledge from its problem-solving strategy, a major concept in modern AI.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üß† The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>In a groundbreaking paper, Newell and Simon proposed this idea, which became a foundational principle of classical AI and cognitive science.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Claim:</strong> They hypothesized that any physical system that can manipulate symbols has the necessary and sufficient means to be intelligent.</li>
                <li><strong>Its Meaning:</strong> This means that both human thought and machine intelligence can be understood as a form of symbolic computation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 6: Legacy & Awards -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>ü§ù Legacy & Awards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Turing Award:</strong> In 1975, Newell and Simon received the A.M. Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science, for their contributions to AI and the psychology of human cognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Founding Figure:</strong> He was instrumental in creating the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University and co-founded the American Association for Artificial Intelligence.</li>
