            <h2>üåç Early Life & Career</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Born:</strong> 1927 in New York City, U.S.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> He earned a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University.</li>
                <li><strong>MIT Connection:</strong> He joined the faculty at MIT in 1958 and, with John McCarthy, co-founded the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Slide 3: The Society of Mind -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üß† The Society of Mind</h2>
            <p>Minsky's most famous work, the book *The Society of Mind*, presents a powerful theory about how human intelligence works.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Idea:</strong> He proposed that the mind is not one big, complex system, but rather a collection of many small, simple "agents."</li>
                <li><strong>How it Works:</strong> These agents, each with a specific task, work together in groups to create what we perceive as intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Influence:</strong> This idea has been very influential in both AI and cognitive science, helping us understand how complex behaviors can arise from simple parts.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Perceptrons and its Impact -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>üñ•Ô∏è The Perceptrons Book</h2>
            <p>In 1969, Minsky co-authored the book *Perceptrons*, which had a major effect on AI research at the time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Finding:</strong> The book showed that a type of simple neural network, called a perceptron, had significant limitations.</li>
                <li><strong>The "AI Winter":</strong> This finding contributed to a period in the 1970s when funding and interest in AI research declined, often called the "AI winter."</li>
                <li><strong>Re-evaluation:</strong> However, the book also pushed the field to develop more advanced neural networks that could overcome these limitations.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Slide 5: Legacy & Awards -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>ü§ù Legacy & Awards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Turing Award:</strong> In 1969, he received the A.M. Turing Award for his work that "helped shape the field of AI."</li>
                <li><strong>Other Honors:</strong> Minsky also received the Japan Prize and the Benjamin Franklin Medal.</li>
                <li><strong>Visionary:</strong> He was a great visionary and was constantly thinking about the future of AI, robotics, and the human mind.</li>
