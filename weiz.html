        <h2>üèõÔ∏è Slide 1: Introduction to Joseph Weizenbaum</h2>
        <p>Born in Berlin, Germany, in 1923, <strong>Joseph Weizenbaum</strong> was a German-American computer scientist. He and his family, who were Jewish, fled Nazi Germany in 1936 and immigrated to the United States. He studied mathematics at Wayne State University, where he earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees.</p>

        <h2>ü§ñ Slide 2: The Creation of ELIZA</h2>
        <p>Weizenbaum is most famous for creating <strong>ELIZA</strong>, an early natural language processing program he developed at MIT between 1964 and 1966. ELIZA was a chatbot that mimicked the responses of a Rogerian psychotherapist by using simple pattern-matching rules. It was designed to demonstrate the superficiality of human-computer communication.</p>

        <h2>ü§Ø Slide 3: The ELIZA Effect and Ethical Shift</h2>
        <p>Weizenbaum was shocked when users began to confide in ELIZA, attributing human-like feelings and understanding to the program. This phenomenon became known as the <strong>ELIZA effect</strong>, highlighting the human tendency to anthropomorphize machines. This experience prompted Weizenbaum to become a vocal critic of AI.</p>

        <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Slide 4: The Warnings of "Computer Power and Human Reason"</h2>
        <p>In his influential 1976 book, <em>Computer Power and Human Reason</em>, Weizenbaum argued that while computers can perform complex calculations, they lack the human qualities of <strong>compassion and wisdom</strong>. He warned against giving machines the responsibility to make crucial decisions, arguing that it was dangerous and dehumanizing to do so. His work initiated a vital ethical debate about the appropriate role of computers and AI in society.</p>

    <div class="slide">
        <h2>üí° Slide 5: Modern-Day AI Influence</h2>
        <p>Joseph Weizenbaum's legacy is twofold: he was an AI pioneer who helped establish the field of natural language processing, and he was one of its most important critics. ELIZA paved the way for modern-day conversational agents and chatbots like Siri and Alexa. More importantly, his ethical warnings continue to be a cornerstone of discussions about AI's limitations and societal implications. His work forces us to consider the line between what computers <strong>can do</strong> and what they <strong>should do</strong>.</p>
